# Hi-Lo
Simple Cardgame created with GML

The game is obviously not too fun and very basice but more then to create a great game it was meant as a first project to teach me about lists, array's and all the other possible functions you encounter in a game. 

I think I would really love to share the code at some point as I think for absolute beginners it takes them through the whole process and is different to RPG's or Jump 'n Runs for which are already enough tutorials. 

As I am a beginner myself it would be great if somebody would be willing to crossread my code and see if it makes sense or if things could have been done easier or better. I wouldn't want to publish it before and give beginners bad examples or bad practices.
